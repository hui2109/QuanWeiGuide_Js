<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a histological diagnosis, which refers to the hyperplasia of glandular
    epithelium, smooth muscle and connective tissue in the transitional zone (TZ) of the prostate, which can cause
    increased prostate stiffness [1]. BPH is very prevalent in older men. The histological morbidity rate confirmed by
    autopsy increases from 40-45 years old, to 60% by age 60 and 80% by age 80 worldwide [2]. BPH can be asymptomatic
    and no treatment is required for this group of patients. However, BPH can lead to benign prostatic enlargement (BPE)
    which can block the bladder neck and cause lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) [3] and brought many concerns for
    aging males.</p>
<p>Histopathological diagnosis is still the gold standard for BPH. However, surgery or biopsy was needed in order to
    acquire specimens. Ultrasound was introduced in the evaluation of BPH for decades, and it has been utilized
    commonly. Transrectal ultrasound elastography is an imaging technology sensitive to tissue stiffness that was first
    described in the 1990s and is widely used in the clinical practice of multiple diseases including depicting prostate
    cancer and guiding prostate biopsy [4-8]. However, most of these studies used quasi-static (strain) elastography
    that is limited by its lack of standardization and operator dependency and by the fact that it cannot provide
    quantitative elasticity data.</p>
<h2>Materials and methods</h2>
<h3>Study Participants</h3>
<p>Between March 2022 and September 2022, consecutive male participants with and without BPH were included, who
    constituted the BPH and control group respectively. The participants included in our analysis (a) were about to
    undergo prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurement and partial prostatectomy (only for BPH group), (b) provided
    informed consent, and (c) were older than 18 years of age. Those excluded from analysis had (a) been diagnosed with
    prostate cancer (only for BPH group) or BPH (only for control group), (b) the history of partial prostatectomy, (c)
    inapplicability for SWE examination because of archostegnosis, (d) unreliable measurement results of SWE. The
    prospective study was undertaken after receiving Ethics Committee approval. All the participants gave written
    informed consent before inclusion in this prospective institutional review board-approved monocentric study.</p>
<h3>Image Acquisition</h3>
<p>All the participants underwent transrectal conventional ultrasound and SWE examinations. Examinations were performed
    with an Aixplorer scanner (SuperSonic Imagine, Aix-en-Provence, France) using a SE12-3 transrectal transducer by two
    sonographers (X.H.Z., with 10 years of conventional ultrasound experience, and D.M.C., with 20 years of SWE
    experience).</p>
<p>The participants were examined in the left decubitus position. Grey-scale and Dopper’s images were obtained in the
    axial and sagittal planes and SWE images were acquired in the axial plane (Fig. 1). Optimized settings (maximized
    penetration, elasticity scale set to 70 kPa) were used as recommended by the manufacturer. The sampling diameter was
    set to 3.00 mm and the sampling depth was set to 1.5 cm for each examination in SWE. The regions of interest (ROIs)
    were placed in the transitional zone (TZ) and peripheral zone (PZ) of the medium prostate gland respectively.
    Measurements were made near the urethra excluded calcified areas. During the SWE examination, the sonographer was
    asked to keep the probe in a steady-state position for a few seconds until stabilization of the color map and to put
    as minimal pressure as possible on the prostate through the transducer, to avoid creating artificial areas of
    increased stiffness in the gland.</p>
<h4>Volume Measurement</h4>
<p>Volumes of the prostate (VP) and the TZ (VTZ) were acquired by means of gray-scale ultrasound. In the axial plane,
    the transverse diameter and anteroposterior diameter of the prostate and the TZ were measured respectively and in
    the sagittal plane, the cephalocaudal diameter of the prostate and the TZ were measured respectively.</p>
